    <h1>So, You Want a PS5.</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Updated February 17, 2021.</p>

    <h4>
        In November 2020, Sony launched the newest iteration of its flagship console, the Playstation 5. 
        As a result of production difficulties induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, massive demand from gamers, 
        and advances in bots that allow scalpers to snap up units, it has become incredibly difficult for people
        to get their hands on the console, even months after its release. For many, trying to get a PS5 is a 24-hour committment, 
        requiring being logged into every site that sells the console, setting up alerts for new stock, and being ready to buy
        a console at any time of day. Is that exactly what Sony wants? Maybe.

        The PS5 has been available for approximately <span class="large">1905 minutes out of 181110 since launch, or 1.05% of the time.</span>
